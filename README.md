## Tema 1
### tema1.py
1st API called is to a random number API found on the internet. This number will be later used to determine which hashtag from the second API we use.
2nd API called is generating top 20 hashtags currently trending on twitter.
3rd API called is the Twitter API which searches for the most recent tweets with the given hashtag.

In the folder you will also find 3 json files metrics - which contains the latency of each hashtag, tokens - the tokens for tweepy / Twitter API, tweets - the text of the tweets.

For the metrics section I measured the time it took for the python script to execute, including all 3 api calls.
